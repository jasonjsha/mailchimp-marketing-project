# Mailchimp Marketing + Wholesale Website Simulation

This project combines a marketing email campaign flyer with an application meant to emulate the website meant for customers to complete purchases and orders. The site is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrates with Supabase for data storage and Vercel for deployment. There is also an information page created to inform the user on the functionality and the information collected through the MailChimp Campaign. Both the information page and the web page are accessible through the email that will be sent out.

## Description of Target Browsers

Because the project involves email marketing, the target browsers would be current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Whether it be through desktop or mobile, the app should be accessible and functional at all times.
