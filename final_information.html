    <h1>How We Use Email Marketing To Better Serve You!</h1>

    <p>
      At VeryBest, we’re always looking for ways to better serve our customers and promote our products more effectively. That’s why we’ve partnered with Mailchimp to create a smarter, data-driven way of reaching out to you. Our new flyer-style email campaigns are designed to not only showcase our products, but also help us learn what you're interested in — so we can keep improving.
    </p>

    <h2>What Our Emails Do</h2>
    <p>
      The emails you receive from us contain flyers that highlight our best-selling wholesale items. Each product includes clear pricing per case, unit counts, and visuals to help you make informed purchasing decisions quickly. We’ve built these emails to be clean, mobile-friendly, and useful for buyers like you.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Chose Mailchimp</h2>
    <p>
      Mailchimp gives us access to built-in analytics that tell us how our emails perform. We can see which products you click on most, what content gets attention, and how well different campaigns are doing. This feedback helps us adjust future promotions to focus on what matters most to our customers — like price, packaging size, or product type.
    </p>

    <h2>How This Helps You</h2>
    <p>
      Using the insights gained from our flyers, we can tailor our promotions to better match your needs. You’ll see more relevant offers, better-curated product selections, and content that’s based on what you, the customer, show interest in. Our goal is to help make your ordering experience faster, easier, and more aligned with what your business is actually looking for.
